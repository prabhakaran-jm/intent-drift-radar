## Prompt iteration and validation notes

During development, Google AI Studio was used as a prompt laboratory to iteratively refine the Gemini 3 reasoning contract.

Early prompt versions produced high-level ideation or feature suggestions. Through role constraints, structured output enforcement, and explicit temporal reasoning rules, the prompt was refined to reliably produce deterministic, evidence-backed intent drift analysis.

The sample output included in this repository represents a validated example of the final production JSON contract after prompt iteration and minor formatting refinements for clarity.
